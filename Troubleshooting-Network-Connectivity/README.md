    TROUBLESHOOTING NETWORK CONNECTIVITY
.

    Challenges of Computer Network
.

    Performance Degradation – 
Many time we have faced loss in data integrity and speed of a network which is generally down to poor transmissions and is also known as performance degradation. Every networks that may be large or small performance issue is everywhere but in large networks this performance degradation issue is high as communication has to be established with in a larger area and also by help of many network devices.
 
    Security Issues – 
When it comes to computer network there this security issue arises. It is one of top issue of computer network and a big challenge to network security engineers which generally involve protecting network from different cyber attacks, preventing unauthorized users to enter and access system, and maintaining network integrity. All these security issues increases with increase in network size when network size is large there chance of security issues are more.
 
    Host Identification – 
Small networks can be easily configured with help of manual addressing, but this becomes a serious problem in large networks when it comes to host identification. Because without any proper address of networking it becomes difficult to establish communication in network. So proper host identification is necessary for a network communication.
 
    Configuration Conflicts – 
Mainly large networks have to deal with configuration conflicts and busy networks, since a lot more traffic is going through it. But in small networks a couple of thousand IP addresses with unique host names are available so there is less chance of conflict in between devices. But now a days this problem is less as network structures are designed in such a way that deals with configuration conflicts.
 
    Capacity Concern – 
Now a days volume of data is so high which is produced from various sources. So network capacity also needs to grow with respect it. Today we are dealing with trends like Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, Data science etc and next year something new will be also added so networks also need to improve capacity needs as well as facing cyber threats.
 
    Slow Connectivity – 
Slow connectivity over a network is more frustrating where a simple task takes a long time to be performed over network. It’s often caused by large file transfers over a large area through network. It becomes an unwanted challenge for users when they work over computer network.
 
    Monitoring and maintenance – 
Monitoring and maintenance of global network is one of big challenge of current time. It becomes very difficult to monitor volume of a traffic in a large network.

    MOST COMMON CORPORARE RESOURCE ISSUES

.

    COMMON HOME NETWORKING ISSUES

 - Remote access to the corporate network.
 - When you're remoted into another server but you're trying to print locally at your home.
 - Network slowness
 - Not seeing other PCs in the network.
 - Dropped connections.
