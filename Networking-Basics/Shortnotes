    NETWORK
Network is the collection of interconnected devices.
A network can categorized in two ways: Connectability & Coverage.
    1. Connectability
> There is a wired connection using an Ethernet cable, which has an eight conductor connector on each end known as an rj45 connector or CAT 5 or CAT 6 cables.
> There is a wireless connection where one can connect to that network, using device's wireless capabilities.
    2. Coverage
> A Personal Area Network or a PAN, is a very small network that interconnects two devices.
> A Local Area Network or a LAN, is usually local to a building, or maybe just an area within that building.
> A Campus Area Network or a CAN, interconnects nearby buildings.
> Metropolitan Area Network or a MAN evadable, which allows a business to connect all of their offices to a MAN.
> Wide Area Network or a WAN, that interconnects networks over large geographical regions. Maybe we have our corporate offices scattered around the country, maybe around the globe.

N/B: VPNs or Virtual Private Networks allows us to virtually have a private network, which is a more secure network, even though our data is flowing over the public internet.

BENEFITS OF NETWORK
1. Network gives us the ability to share resources.
2. Enhences communication.
3. Network provides redundancy.
4. Network enables internet access.
5. It enables a single point of administration for network administrators.

NETWORK ADDRESSES

 1. Media Access Control address (MAC address) is the specific physical address assigned by manufacturers to networking devices using Network Interface Card(NIC). MAC addresses have 48 bits. The bits are divides into two parts; the first 24 bits are known as the Vendors's code or Organationally Unique Identifier(OUI).
 2. IP version 4 addresse is a logical address because it's an address that needs to be assigned to the device as opposed to a MAC address, which is coded into the hardware by the manufacturer. 
 An IPv4 address is 32 bits in length, with four different groupings of eight bits separated by dots, and each of these eight bit groupings called octet.
 The first 16 bits of IP4 address represent the network, and the last 16 bits represent the host.
 N/B; There are so many network devices in the world, it's not possible for each of them to have a unique IPv4 address, Network Address Translation (NAT) provides a walk around on it.
 3. IP Version 6 (To be updated with a simpler explanation).

 PARTS OF A NETWORK.

 - Network Interface Card (NIC) is a circuitry that allow us to send and receive data on either a wired or wireless network.
 - Switches learn what Mac addresses live off of which ports. When a frame comes into the switch destined for a specific Mac address, if the switch already learned the Mac address it will only forward that frame out of the port connecting out to that destination Mac address.
